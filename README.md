# 🧠 Image Classification with Neural Networks

This project demonstrates how to build a simple **neural network model for image classification** — a supervised machine learning task — using foundational AI concepts.

> ⚙️ Developed as part of a university-level project for the Computer Science program.

## 📌 Project Summary

We implemented a neural network that classifies images based on visual patterns learned during training. The project focuses on understanding how neural networks process image data and how different layers (input, hidden, output) work together to produce accurate predictions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a simple image classifier using neural networks
- Understand how activation functions, layers, and weights affect prediction
- Train and evaluate the model on a labeled dataset
- Measure accuracy and optimize performance

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset used was a labeled collection of images (e.g. animals, objects).
- Images were resized and normalized before training.
- Classes included [replace with actual classes if available, e.g. Cats / Dogs / Cars / etc.]

## 🧪 Results

- Model was able to learn from the image data and correctly classify a high percentage of samples after training.
- Performance was measured using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Visual output of predictions was displayed for sample test images.
